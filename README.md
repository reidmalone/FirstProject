I pulled my data from https://www.pro-football-reference.com. They have an option to where you can download the file as a .csv. I used this, and got one for each year, 1969-2018. Also it is useful to highlight certain things, for example in 2007 Tom Brady and the Patriots had a historical year, and you can see that reflected with the stats. I really enjoyed getting to use D3 for this project, and it was my first exposure to any web development really. Below are some screenshots that highlight two things of this visualization.

 You can see the average total here is: 3645.

 In 1969 the average was a lot lower than in 2018 as seen below.
 It is interesting to see how far the NFL has evolved in just 50 years.
